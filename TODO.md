# To do
- index submission with html file and relative links
- distribute entropy distribution
- fix all todos
- test other datasets
- pruning?
- ARFF?
- leaks?
- dataset given to ddti should not contain headers, and only categorical data

- templated Induction/Task classes with matrix type?
- cite mlpack
- currently only handles dataset with categorical attributes so: discretisation
